This is my website design guide project. It is apart from codecademy's assignment. In this project I used different colors for background and font. I also used three different types of Google Font.
As I identified which font will be used for headers, subheading and paragraphs. It is just a small project by HTML and CSS. I will add for it as my knowledge expand.
